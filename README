Space Invaders GPL
by Coolcord

The goal of this project was to write Space Invaders under the Game Programming 
Language (GPL). The game is completely functional, although there are a few 
minor bugs.

To start the game, simply run the start.sh bash script. This will start the GPL
interpreter and load the "SpaceInvaders.gpl" file. It is important to note that
the included GPL binary will only work on 64-bit (x86_64) Linux systems. If you are 
running a 32-bit Linux operating system or a 64-bit Mac operating system, the 
according GPL binaries to play the game can be found here:
http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~tyson/classes/515.s14/bin/linux/
Simply download the according version and replace the file "gpl" with the new one.
Make sure that it is still named "gpl"!

The game can be played with either mouse or keyboard (or some combination of 
the two if preferred). To move the tank, either use the arrow keys or move the 
mouse. To shoot, press the space bar or click.

More information about the programming of the game can be found at the top of 
the file "SpaceInvaders.gpl".
